# Virtual_Assistant
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A Voice Assistant powered by ElevenLabs Conversational AI! 🎙️🤖

Using Python, I built a smart voice-based assistant that can:
✅ Recognize the user's schedule
✅ Start meaningful conversations
✅ Speak naturally using ElevenLabs' voice technology
✅ Respond in real time based on voice input

🔐 I securely handled API credentials using .env files, and used callbacks to manage assistant responses, interruptions, and user transcripts dynamically.

🧠 Tech Stack:

Python

ElevenLabs Conversational AI

dotenv for secure API handling

Real-time audio via microphone & speaker

🎯 This project helped me strengthen my skills in API integration, environment management, and voice-based interfaces — all of which are crucial in today's AI-driven world.
